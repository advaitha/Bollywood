This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
bollywood <- read.csv("bollywood.csv")
```
```{r}
#Q1> Identify for every actor,  count of film in each verdict category and sum of total collections in each category, sorted by Count and then sum of total collections, both descending
library(tidyverse)
q1 <- bollywood %>% group_by(Lead, Verdict) %>% summarise(Count = n(), Total = sum(Tcollection)) %>% arrange(Lead, -Count, -Total)
q1
```
```{r}
#Q2> How can we ensure in the above result there is only 1 row per actor without lose of any information? (Hint: information from rows have to be spread to columns)
q2.1 <- q1 %>% select(-Total) %>% spread(Verdict, Count, fill=0) %>% as.data.frame() %>%  rename_if(.predicate = is.numeric, .funs = funs(paste(., "count", sep=".")))
q2.2 <- q1 %>% select(-Count) %>% spread(Verdict, Total, fill=0) %>% as.data.frame() %>%  rename_if(.predicate = is.numeric, .funs = funs(paste(., "Total", sep=".")))
q2 <- q2.1 %>% inner_join(q2.2, by = c("Lead"))
q2
```

```{r}
#Q3> Identify actors whose earning per Hit is greater than other actors earnings per Superhit, identify both set of actors
q3.1 <- q1 %>% mutate(PerFilm = Total/Count) %>% select(-Count, -Total) 
q3.2 <- q3.1 %>% filter(Verdict == "Hit" | Verdict == "Super Hit") %>% spread(Verdict, PerFilm, fill = 0) 
names(q3.2) <- names(q3.2) %>% make.names()
q3.3 <- q3.2 %>% as.data.frame() %>% select(-Lead) 
q3 <- q3.3 %>% pmap_dbl(function(Hit, Super.Hit){ifelse(Hit > Super.Hit, Hit, NA)}) %>% na.omit() %>% map(function(x){
  col_names <- q3.2 %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(Hit == x) %>% select(Lead) %>% mutate(Lead = as.character(Lead)) %>% unlist()
  
  col_values <- q3.2 %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(Super.Hit < x, Super.Hit!= 0) %>% select(Lead) %>% mutate(Lead = as.character(Lead)) %>% unlist() %>% paste(collapse = ",")
  l1 <- list(col_values)
  names(l1) <- col_names

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
